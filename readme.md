# Obsidian plugin - VaultSync

VaultSync enables file synchronization between Obsidian vaults over a local WLAN connection.

## Features

- **One-Click Sync**: Synchronize your Obsidian vault with a button press
- **Local WLAN Only**: Keep your data private by syncing only over your local network
- **No Cloud Required**: Direct device-to-device synchronization without third-party services

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Multiple devices running Obsidian
  - VaultSync plugin installed on all devices
- Devices connected to the same WLAN network

### Installation

1. Download the VaultSync plugin from the repository
2. Install in your Obsidian vault through the Community Plugins section
3. Enable the plugin in Obsidian settings

### Configuration

1. Open VaultSync settings in Obsidian
2. Set a unique identifier for your vault
3. Configure which folders to include/exclude from synchronization
4. Save your settings

## Usage

1. Make changes to your vault on any device
2. Click the "Sync" button in the Obsidian ribbon
3. Wait for the synchronization to complete
4. Your changes are now available on all connected devices

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all devices are connected to the same WLAN
- Check firewall settings if connections are being blocked
- Restart the plugin if synchronization issues persist

###### Reason
I wanted to use Obsidian on my phone and my PC but I dislike the idea of 'cloud' of any kind and shape. Why not use Git? - You could use it, but Git is not designed for large files like photos, videos, etc.
